## Integration with Core Systems

### Staff License Management
```javascript
// Automated license monitoring
var license = new GlideRecord('u_staff_license');
license.addQuery('expiration_date', '<=', gs.daysAgo(-90));
license.addQuery('license_status', 'Active');
license.query();

while (license.next()) {
    // Create compliance case
    var compliance = new GlideRecord('sn_compliance_case');
    compliance.initialize();
    compliance.policy = getLicensePolicy();
    compliance.staff_member = license.staff_member;
    compliance.due_date = license.expiration_date;
    compliance.priority = calculatePriority(license.expiration_date);
    compliance.insert();
}
```

### Risk Assessment Automation
```javascript
// Risk scoring calculation
function calculateRiskScore(probability, impact) {
    var score = probability * impact;
    var rating = 'Low';

    if (score >= 16) rating = 'High';
    else if (score >= 6) rating = 'Medium';

    return {
        score: score,
        rating: rating,
        action_required: score >= 16
    };
}
```
