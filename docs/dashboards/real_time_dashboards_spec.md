### Data Sources
```javascript
// Real-time appointment data
var appointments = new GlideAggregate('u_appointment');
appointments.addQuery('appointment_date', '>=', gs.beginningOfToday());
appointments.addQuery('appointment_date', '<=', gs.endOfToday());
appointments.addAggregate('COUNT');
appointments.groupBy('appointment_status');

// Wait time calculation
var waitTimes = new GlideAggregate('u_appointment');
waitTimes.addQuery('check_in_time', '!=', '');
waitTimes.addQuery('appointment_date', '>=', gs.beginningOfToday());
waitTimes.addAggregate('AVG', 'wait_time_minutes');
```

### Performance Optimization
- Cached queries for frequently accessed data
- Incremental data refreshes
- Asynchronous loading for complex calculations
